title: Deep Illumination
---



This project has two main objectives:

1. Create a tool for scholars and students to help identify Biblical scenes by automatically detecting illuminations, objects, people, actions and subjects using neural networks and AI, based on the presence of a combination of objects and textual clues.
2. Create Illuminator profiles using several features such as colours, saturation, edges, symmetry, objects, and other details to determine specific patterns. It includes localisation and dating details to determine specific illuminator profiles and track evolutions. The aim is also to find evolutions and patterns according to dates and places, to detect what is different across a corpus.
   

A project in collaboration with Dr. David Wrisley, New-York University Abu Dhabi; Christofer Meinecke, Universität Leipzig and Dr. Stefan Jänicke, University of Southern Denmark.
