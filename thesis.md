# Yale University
I am currently a fully funded PhD candidate in Medieval Studies at Yale University (2022–ongoing), where I also earned an M.A. and M.Phil in Medieval Studies (2025). My advisors are [Prof. Jessica Brantley](https://english.yale.edu/people/tenured-and-tenure-track-faculty-professors/jessica-brantley) and [Dr. Alex Gil](https://span-port.yale.edu/people/alexander-gil-fuentes). Alongside my PhD, I completed certificates in [Public Humanities](https://ph.yale.edu/), [Material Histories of the Human Record](https://materialhistories.yale.edu/), and [Digital Humanities](https://dhlab.yale.edu/awards/certificate.html).

At Yale, my experience has been deeply interdisciplinary, combining manuscript studies, digital humanities, museum work, and public engagement. I serve as a Digital Humanities Consultant at the [Yale DH Lab](https://dhlab.yale.edu/) (2024–ongoing), and I have taught or co-taught courses ranging from large undergraduate lectures (HIST 211: *Birth of Europe, 1000–1500*) to seminars built around teaching with collections at the Beinecke Library (ENGL 114: *The Tortured Artist*; FREN 191: *Literary Translation*). I also taught in the graduate seminar *Introduction to Public Humanities*.

Outside the classroom, I have been active in Yale’s academic and community life: co-creating the Yale Digital Humanities Graduate Student Colloquium, serving as an elected representative on the [Graduate Student Assembly](https://gsa.yale.edu/), and chairing the [Yale Lectures in Medieval Studies](https://medieval.yale.edu/yale-lectures-medieval-studies), where I fundraised $22,000 to support the program in 2024-2025.


# Dissertation
*“Qui scripsit scribat semper.” Female Scribal Practices in Medieval Europe*

My dissertation is a recovery project devoted to identifying and contextualizing the work of female scribes in Europe before 1600. For centuries, the contributions of women to book production have been understudied or overlooked. My project seeks to change that by combining traditional codicology and paleography with computational methods such as handwritten text recognition, stylometry, and data-driven analysis.

So far, I have recovered evidence of over 1,000 women scribes active across Europe, with many more to come. By building a large open-access dataset, I aim not only to quantify and map women’s involvement in manuscript culture but also to analyze their working environments, education, collaborations, and the types of texts they copied. My broader goal is to reshape how we understand the economy of manuscript production, literacy, and authorship in the Middle Ages.


# Honors, Fellowships, and Grants
My research has been supported by numerous internal and external awards, including:  
- [MacMillan International Dissertation Research Fellowship](https://macmillan.yale.edu/) (Yale, 2025)  
- [Bourse Mark Pigott – Humanités Numériques](https://www.bnf.fr/fr/appel-chercheurs-associes-2025-2026), Bibliothèque nationale de France (2025)  
- [Sterling Prize Fellowship](https://gsas.yale.edu/funding-aid/internal-fellowships/sterling-prize-fellowship) (Yale University, 2022–24)  
- [International Center of Medieval Art (ICMA)](https://www.medievalart.org/) Student Travel Grant (2025)  
- Multiple conference, summer school, and research travel bursaries in the US and Europe.  

These fellowships have enabled me to pursue archival research across Europe, attend advanced training programs in manuscript studies and digital methods, and share my work at international conferences.


# Service and Professional Engagement
I am committed to service, collaboration, and public humanities. At [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), I have been an elected [Graduate Student Assembly](https://gsa.yale.edu/) representative, co-captain of the [Graduate Rugby Football Club](https://www.yalegradrugby.org/), and organizer of graduate student colloquia.  

Beyond Yale, I served on the [Digital Medievalist Postgraduate Committee](https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/) and am currently a member of professional associations including the [Medieval Academy of America](https://medievalacademy.org/), the [International Center of Medieval Art](https://www.medievalart.org/), and the [European Association for Digital Humanities](https://eadh.org/).
