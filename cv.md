I can help graduate students designing their curriculum vitae both for academia and industry jobs, in an American or French context. 

# Why designing a CV is important?

Goals and expectations for Academia and Industry are different. Designing the perfect CV is an art and I can help you.

For academia, a CV is used to showcase your research, teaching, and service experience. The emphasis is on demonstrating the your intellectual contributions and expertise, as well as your ability to secure grants and funding. A CV for academia should highlight your research publications, conference presentations, and academic awards and honors amongst other things.

For industry, a CV is used to showcase your work experience, achievements and the skills relevant to the job you are applying for. The emphasis is on demonstrating your ability to deliver results, solve problems, and meet deadlines. An industry CV should be tailored to the specific requirements of the job you are applying for.


# How I can help you

- **Help you understand the job requirements:** Ask the person what kind of job they are applying for and what the specific requirements and qualifications are. This information will help you tailor the CV to the job.

- **Help you review your background and experience:** Look at the person's existing CV or resume and discuss their career history, skills, and accomplishments. Identify what is most relevant to the job they are applying for and what should be emphasized in the CV.

- **Help you choose the right format:** Choose a CV format that is appropriate for the job they are applying for. For example, a chronological CV format is best for people with a solid work history, while a functional CV format is better for people with skills and experience in different areas.

- **Highlight relevant experience:** Emphasize the person's experience that is most relevant to the job they are applying for. This includes work experience, skills, and accomplishments that demonstrate their ability to perform the job.

- **Write compelling content:** Use clear, concise language and powerful action verbs to describe the person's experience and accomplishments. Avoid using jargon or technical language that may not be understood by hiring managers.

- **Edit and proofread:** Review the CV for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Ensure that the CV is easy to read and free of errors that could detract from the person's qualifications.
