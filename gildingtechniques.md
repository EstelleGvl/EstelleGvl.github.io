Several alterations have been observed on the gilded illuminations of a LAD Bible (LAD 2013.051). The project aims to identify the degraded components of the illuminations using stereomicroscopic analysis and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and other techniques, as required, to understand the deterioration process and thus potentially improve the conservation of the artwork as well as open new prospects into the materials and techniques used in medieval illuminated manuscripts.

A project in collaboration with Dr. Elsa Bourguignon, Louvre Abu Dhabi, and Dr. Pablo Londero, Louvre Abu Dhabi.
