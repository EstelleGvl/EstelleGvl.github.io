I am a French Assistant Curator and Researcher. I am starting my PhD journey in Medieval Studies at Yale and was previously working for several cultural institutions.

After an education in History, Art History and Archaeology at University Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, I worked at the National Library of France in the medieval manuscripts department, at the National Museum of Middle Ages in Paris, at the Air and Space museum, in archives and the private sector.

In 2016, I was hired by the France-Museums agency to help prepare the opening of a new world-class museum in the Gulf: the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In July 2018, I joined the new “Research and Development” Department at Louvre Abu Dhabi where I was, amongst other responsibilities, developing academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.

In 2022, I am moving to Yale University as a PhD student in Medieval Studies where I will be working on a new methodology to identify medieval female scribes.
