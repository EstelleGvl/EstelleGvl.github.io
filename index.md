I am a French Assistant Curator and Researcher, currently working at Louvre Abu Dhabi. 

In 2016, I was hired by the France-Museums agency to help prepare the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi project. In July 2018, I joined the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the new “Research and Development” Department where I am helping to develop academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.
