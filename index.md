I am a French Curator and Researcher and I am currently a PhD candidate in Medieval Studies at Yale. I also hold B.A.s in History and Art History and M.A.s in History and the Management of Cultural Heritage from Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne.  

In 2022, I moved to Yale University to pursue <a href="https://medieval.yale.edu/people/estelle-gu-ville">my PhD</a> in Medieval Studies where I am working on medieval female scribes. I also co-created the Yale Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium, a working group bringing together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry and served as a member then Chair of the Yale Lecture in Medieval Studies Committee as well as in the Post-Graduate Digital Medievalist Committee.
