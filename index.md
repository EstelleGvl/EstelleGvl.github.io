I am a historian of the medieval book, with a career spanning museums, libraries, and universities. My research explores manuscripts, scribal practices, illumination, gender, and cultural exchange, often through the lens of digital humanities and quantitative analysis.

I am currently a <a href="https://medieval.yale.edu/people/estelle-gu-ville">PhD candidate</a>  at Yale University, where my dissertation focuses on recovering the work of female scribes in medieval Europe. Beyond academia, I have worked at institutions such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and Yale’s Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, curating exhibitions and making collections accessible to broader audiences.

This site brings together my research, projects, and publications as well as a glimpse into my career in museums, public humanities, and digital scholarship.
