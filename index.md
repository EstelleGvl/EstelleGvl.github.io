I am a French Curator and Researcher and I am currently a PhD candidate in Medieval Studies at Yale. I also hold B.A.s in History and Art History and M.A.s in History and the Management of Cultural Heritage from Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne.

Before joining Yale, I worked for several cultural institutions in France and the Gulf, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the Bibliothèque nationale de France  in the medieval manuscripts department, the Musée national du Moyen Age - Thermes de Cluny in Paris, the Air and Space museum in le Bourget, in archives and the private sector.

In 2016, I was hired by the France-Museums agency to help prepare the opening of a new world-class museum in the Gulf: the Louvre Abu Dhabi. I was responsible for the medieval and islamic collections and worked on exhbitions, acquisitions, documentation and collection management, education and research projects. In July 2018, I joined the new “Research and Development” Department at Louvre Abu Dhabi where I was, among other responsibilities, developing academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.

In 2022, I moved to Yale University to pursue <a href="https://medieval.yale.edu/people/estelle-gu-ville">my PhD</a> in Medieval Studies where I am working on medieval female scribes. I also co-created the Yale Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium, a working group bringing together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry and served as a member then Chair of the Yale Lecture in Medieval Studies Committee as well as in the Post-Graduate Digital Medievalist Committee.
