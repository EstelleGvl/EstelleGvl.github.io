I am a French Assistant Curator and Researcher. I am starting my PhD journey in Medieval Studies at Yale and was previously  working at several cultural institutions.

After a formation in History, Art History and Archaeology at University Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, I gained experience working at the National Library of France in the medieval manuscripts department, at the National Museum of Middle Ages in Paris, at the Air and Space museum, in archives and the private sector.

In 2016, I was hired by the France-Museums agency to help prepare the opening of a new world-class museum in the Gulf: the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In July 2018, I joined the new “Research and Development” Department at Louvre Abu Dhabi where I was, amongst other responsibilities, helping to develop academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.
