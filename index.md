I am a French Assistant Curator and Researcher, currently working at Louvre Abu Dhabi. 

In 2016, I was hired by the France-Museums agency to help prepare the opening of a new world-class museum in the Gulf: the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In July 2018, I joined the new “Research and Development” Department at Louvre Abu Dhabi where I am, amongst other responsibilities, helping to develop academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.
