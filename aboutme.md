I am a French Assistant Curator and Researcher, currently working at Louvre Abu Dhabi. 

In 2016, I joined the France-Museums agency for the Louvre Abu Dhabi project, where I participated in the opening of the museum. In July 2018, I joined the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the new “Research and Development” Department where I am helping to develop academic research in several fields, including research on medieval collections using digital methods.
