title: Paris Bible Project (PBP)
---

The project wishes to challenge the idea of uniformity of Paris Bibles, a standardized model that was created and spread in Europe in the 13th century: looking at the use of abbreviations, it is possible to notice different approaches to the text. The Paris Bible Project aims to understand the production and diffusion of these Bibles in Europe using handwritten text recognition (HTR) and other digital tools, looking at the spelling and abbreviation of words as distinctive features for localization or dating purposes. 

We have [presented and published](https://estellegvl.github.io/publications/) extensively about the project and are currently working on a monograph titled "Machine Learning and Medieval Manuscripts: Big Data, Scribes, and the â€œParis Bible", under contract with Arc Humanities Press.

A project in collaboration with Dr. David Wrisley, New-York University Abu Dhabi.
